# GSoC-2023
This repository explains my work throughout GSoC 2023 at CERN-HSF.

Here is the link to my proposal:

Since when coding period began, I started working on the cartesian grid. I successfully created one, customizable and interactive, as well as added labels.

Here is the link to the PR:
https://github.com/HSF/phoenix/pull/587

But I failed to run the CI/CD. After which, my mentor helped me run those, and here is another PR for the same:

https://github.com/HSF/phoenix/pull/612

I then added two other features: 
1. To find the 3D coordinate of any point and distances between two points.
2. Translation of the cartesian grid.

This time, I managed to run the CI/CD. Here is the PR:

https://github.com/HSF/phoenix/pull/616

Next, I have added the functionality to list all the geometries, and there is a button in front of each of them to highlight it.

Here is the PR:
